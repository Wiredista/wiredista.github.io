<html><head><title> Life is fucking ridiculous </title></head><body>If I die, will someone care?  <br>
I mean, will someone really care?  <br>
maybe they cry for a day or two, but someone will remember me after a month or a year?  <br>
I always tought I was important in the world but I see I'm nothing afterall... <br>
Will someone miss me if I dissapear for a week or two? Have anyone ever noticed my absence anywhere?  <br>
Maybe I'll just keep working in the hope that I'll get a better job in the future after some years of study but maybe that's all bullshit.  <br>
I wake up 6am, I get dressed, I get my bus, work all the day, I get home then what? Nobody sent me a message, nobody asked me if I'm okay (beside those who ask by politeness).  <br>
Yesterday I got home on foot because nobody cared about that guy who ran out of bus ticket.   <br>
...  <br>
Afterall... Somebody really cares about me?  <br>
Even you. Would you care enough to waste 2 minutes of your life translating and reading this shit? <br>
Afterall, who is this pyromaniac 'pseudorussian' guy in the world history?  <br>
Nobody likes my musics, nobody likes my hobbies, nobody care about my achievements. That guy who calls himself 'Russo' is nobody  <br>
